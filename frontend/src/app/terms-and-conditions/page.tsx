                By using this site, you warrant that you are at least 18 years of age or are accessing the site under the supervision of a parent or guardian. You agree to use the site only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.

                <Info className="w-5 h-5 text-gheeGold" /> 2. Pricing & Product Availability
              </h2>
              <p>
                All prices listed on the website are in Indian Rupees (INR) and are subject to change without prior notice. We make every effort to display accurate pricing; however, technical errors can happen. We reserve the right to cancel any orders placed at incorrect prices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Product availability is subject to change. Listing a product on the website does not guarantee that the stock is ready for immediate packing and dispatch.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Section 3 */}

              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Product images shown on this website are for representative purposes only.</strong> 
              </p>
              <p>
                While we strive to represent colors, consistency, and packaging containers as accurately as possible, the actual batch color, texture, or jar appearance may vary slightly due to natural variations in agricultural sourcing, processing batches, or packaging container updates.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                Placement of an order does not constitute final acceptance. All orders are subject to stock validation and payment confirmation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because we operate via manual UPI payment transfers, <strong>your order will not be packed or dispatched until we successfully verify and match your uploaded payment screenshot</strong> with our bank deposits.
              </p>
              <p>
                We reserve the right to immediately cancel orders, restrict website access, or reject transactions if there is a suspected misuse of the platform, submission of fake or altered payment screenshots, or any fraudulent order attempts.
